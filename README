This is a Jabber GnuPG Plugin (XEP-0027) for Pidgin taking advantage of Pidgin's scripting capabilities.
This code is distributed under the terms of the GPLv3.


== INSTALL ==

- Download 'gnugp-plugin.pl' to ~/.purple/plugins or $PREFIX/lib/purple (creating the directory if it doesn't exist)
- Edit it: find the line 'my $MY_KEY_ID = '0xDCC51FA6';' at the beginning of the file and change '0xDCC51FA6' to your GPG key ID.
- Make sure you have the Crypt::GPG perl plugin, for example:
 - under Ubuntu: aptitude install libcrypt-gpg-perl
 - or using CPAN:
  - perl -MCPAN -e shell
  - cpan> install Crypt::GPG
- Start pidgin and enable the "Jabber GnuPG Plugin" under Tools > Plugins 


== USAGE ==

In a Jabber chat, type "enablegpg" to start an encrypted conversation or "disablegpg" to end it.
The activation/deactivation of encryption will be notified to you by a popup window.


== CAVEATS ==

You cannot assign a GPG key to a contact, it will be picked out automatically.
For this to work however, there as to be a public key in your gpg keyring matching the jabber address of the person you want to talk to in Pidgin using encryption.

In any case it is good enoug for my personal use, its original purpose.
I may or may not improve the plugin in the future, depending on users' interesst in it.
Feel free to enhance the code, submit a patch or open a bug ticket.
